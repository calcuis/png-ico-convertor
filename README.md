### png to ico convertor

This Python code utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL), specifically the `Image` module, to convert a PNG image into an ICO (Icon) file format. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing the PIL module:
```
from PIL import Image
```
This line imports the `Image` module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The `Image` module provides functionality for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats.

Opening a PNG image:
```
png_image = Image.open("logo.png")
```
The code uses the `Image.open()` method to open the PNG image file named "logo.png." This creates an Image object (png_image) that represents the content of the PNG image.

Saving the image in ICO format:
```
png_image.save("logo.ico", format='ICO', sizes=[(24, 24)])
```
The `save()` method is used to save the opened PNG image in ICO format. The parameters passed to the `save()` method are as follows:
- `"logo.ico"`: Specifies the filename for the saved ICO file.
- `format='ICO'`: Indicates that the image should be saved in ICO format.
- `sizes=[(24, 24)]`: Specifies the sizes for which the ICO file should contain icon images. In this case, a single size of 24x24 pixels is specified. ICO files can contain multiple images of different sizes to be used in different contexts, such as different display resolutions.

In summary, this Python code opens a PNG image file named "logo.png," and then it saves the image in ICO format with a specified size of 24x24 pixels, resulting in an ICO file named "logo.ico" containing an icon image suitable for a 24x24 pixel resolution.
